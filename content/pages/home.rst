My research interests revolve around the use of computing to facilitate scientific research and to improve human health. More specifically, I am interested in the areas of computer vision, computational photography/microscopy, and machine learning. (Note: interest does not imply expertise....)

Currently, I am a research engineer at the `Allen Institute for Cell Science <https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/cell-science/>`_, where I develop deep learning models on microscopy images of stem cells.
