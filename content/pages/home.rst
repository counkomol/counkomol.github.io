My research interests revolve around the use of computing to facilitate scientific research and to improve human health. More specifically, I am interested in the areas of computer vision, computational photography/microscopy, and machine learning. (Note: interest does not imply expertise....)

Currently, I am a research engineer at the `Allen Institute`_ for Cell Science, where I develop deep learning models on microscopy images of stem cells.
